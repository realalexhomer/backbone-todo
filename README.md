# backbone-express-mongoose-skeleton
extremely minimal skeleton to use with express 4, backbone and mongoose. Doesn't include any tests or task runners. 

Some basic models are included to show how they work. Users and basic encryption are included via the node encryption middleware.

The structure of this application is pretty modular and nice which is why I made it. Thanks to [guyellis's MEAN repository](https://github.com/guyellis/MEANAppsFiles) for inspiration / great examples.
